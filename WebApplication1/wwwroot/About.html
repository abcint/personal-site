    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>     I'm very excited yet concerned about the current state of softare and computing.
    <p>     Security is starting to become more popular, and hopefully we can build upon this. What concerns me is that true security & stability measures <i> almost always </i> follows implementation.
    <p>     Sure we have better security "built in", this idea makes developers assume their system is completely safe. Every new layer could be a vulnerability, and adds to our software environment (more complexity).
    <p>     On top of this; we are increasing energy usage by adding more cores,  off-loading to the cloud, and adding more "things" on the internet. </p>
